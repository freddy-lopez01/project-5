# UOCIS322 - Project #5

In this project I implemented built off from where we left off in project 4 and implemented a data base aspect to the project using Docker and Mongo. I created a new file called mymongo.py that handles inserting and fetching data from said database. I also created a test file for the functions in mymongo.py to ensure that the function is doing what I expected it to do. I was able to successfully insert data obtained from the user and save it to a database and successfully fetch said saved data if the user so desired.
