# UOCIS322 - Project #5
# Author: Freddy Lopez
# 

In this project I implemented built off from where we left off in project 4 and implemented a data base aspect to the project using Docker and Mongo. I created a new file called mymongo.py that handles inserting and fetching data from said database. I also created a test file for the functions in mymongo.py to ensure that the function is doing what I expected it to do. As of 12:44am on 03/02/2023, I have yet to understand how to implement the javascript needed for fetch in calc.html but as soon as I figure it out I will push my changes and hopefully be eligible for a regrade. whoops. The javascript aspect so far in this project has been pretty challenging for me personally
